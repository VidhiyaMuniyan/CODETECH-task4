 Refactored To-Do List Application

 Brief Description

This is a simple web-based **To-Do List Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The original version contained redundant code, unclear naming, and performance issues related to DOM rendering.

The project has been **refactored** to improve:
**Code readability** with meaningful variable and function names  
**Maintainability** by modularizing the logic  
**Performance** by optimizing DOM updates using native JavaScript methods instead of full HTML re-rendering



 Objective

Refactor an open-source project to improve:
- **Readability**
- **Structure**
- **Performance**



 Tech Stack

| Layer       | Technology         |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Frontend    | HTML, CSS          |
| Scripting   | JavaScript (Vanilla) |
| Tools Used  | VS Code, Browser DevTools |



 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-refactor.git
   cd todo-refactor
````

2. **Open the project**
   Open `index.html` in your browser using VS Code Live Server or double-click the file.



 Project Structure

```
todo-refactor/
├── index.html     # Main HTML file
├── style.css      # Styling
├── script.js      # JavaScript logic (refactored)
```



 Key Changes Made

| Type            | Before                        | After (Refactored)                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Variable Naming | `adItem`, `remov`, `t`        | `addItem`, `removeItem`, `todoList` |
| DOM Updates     | InnerHTML overwrite per loop  | DOM elements created directly       |
| Modularity      | All logic in global functions | Separated functions and better flow |
| Clarity         | Obscure logic                 | Self-explanatory functions          |



 Performance & Readability Impact

* DOM updates are now faster and less error-prone.
* Code is easier to read, extend, and debug.
* Fewer browser reflows due to direct DOM manipulation.


 Conclusion

This project showcases how a basic JavaScript application can be **significantly improved** through thoughtful **refactoring**. It now has cleaner code, improved structure, and better performance, making it easier to maintain or scale in the future.
